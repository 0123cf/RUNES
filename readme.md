The first paragraph is the total amount
The content of the second end is SYMBOL, DECIMALS,
According to the original text SYMBOL it only allows content from A-Z, but how they are added up is a problem

For this reason, the index is difficult to parse. I suggest that DECIMALS be limited to 99, which is two digits, so that the second push can be easily parsed.
